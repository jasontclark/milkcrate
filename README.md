A 'not-so' secret compartment that hosts my favorite bash and python scripts.

The name _milkcrate_ comes from my days as a DJ, carrying all of our records in milkcrates to spin at clubs and college parties.  Back in my day, most DJs had this same burden to bear, and often times, I'd peek into fellow DJs record collection to see what they had.
